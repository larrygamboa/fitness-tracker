## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Purpose

The purpose of the assignment is to create a workout tracker. When a user visits the page, they are given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:
1. Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
2. Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
3. View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
4. View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.

## Usage

1. Visit https://morning-dawn-77684.herokuapp.com/
2. Click "New Workout" button.
3. Enter a new workout by selecting a new exercise from the dropdown menu and fill out the corresponding fields then click the "Add Exercise" button.
4. Once you have successfully entered a new exercise, go to the dashboard link to view the stats of the exercises for your workout.
5. To continue a workout, click the "Continue Workout" button. You can add a new exercise or complete a workout. Review your stats for your workout for the day.
